# Organization Overview

Kyokushindo also tries to establish new standards within its organizational framework. Considering economic differences in countries, the goal of the International Kyokushindo Organization is to provide countries of developing and emerging countries with financial support. As soon as the IKO has built up a financial basis for this support, an international and independent committee will be established to deal with this issue. Furthermore, the INTERNATIONAL KYOKUSHINDO ORGANISATION has the intentionto reward fighters for their effort on tournaments because Kancho Hagen Behboudi is aware of the time, power and money fighters invest while preparing for tournaments. Hopefully, the above mentioned explanations demonstrated that Kyokushindo is a revolutionary Karate. In contrast to other “new” styles which only changed a name and symbol without providing a considerable change, Kyokushindo is really new. It has a philosophy linking to those of the traditional Karate but also giving new aspects. Kyokushindo is a modern, new and flexible Karate style able to adjust itself to any combat situation and free of any prejudice against any nationality, ethnicity or religion.
